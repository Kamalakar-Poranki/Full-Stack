          <h2>British-American rapper</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Daniel Dumile; (July 13, 1971 – October 31, 2020), also known by his stage name MF Doom or simply Doom (both stylized in all caps), was a British-American rapper and record producer. Noted for his intricate wordplay, signature metal mask, and "supervillain" stage persona, Dumile became a major figure of underground hip hop and alternative hip hop in the 2000s. After his death, Variety described him as one of the scene's "most celebrated, unpredictable and enigmatic figures".

          <h2>Career Works</h2> <br>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <dt>1988–1997: KMD, Subroc's death, and hiatus:</dt>
              <dd>As Zev Love X,[18] Dumile formed the hip hop group KMD in 1988 with his younger brother DJ Subroc and Rodan, who was later replaced by Onyx the Birthstone Kid.[19] A&R representative Dante Ross learned of KMD through the hip hop group 3rd Bass and signed them to Elektra Records.[20] Their recording debut came on 3rd Bass's song "The Gas Face" on The Cactus Album,[19] followed in 1991 by their debut album Mr. Hood. Dumile performed the last verse on "The Gas Face"; according to Pete Nice's verse on the track, Dumile created the phrase.[2</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
              <dt>1997–2001: Operation: Doomsday and production work:</dt>
              <dd>In 1997 or 1998,[b] Dumile began freestyling incognito at open-mic events at the Nuyorican Poets Café in Manhattan, obscuring his face by putting tights over his head.[8][28] He turned this into a new identity, MF Doom, with a mask similar to that of Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Doom.[29] He later used a mask based on the character Maximus from the 2000 film Gladiator.[30]</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
              <dt>2002–2004: King Geedorah, Viktor Vaughn, and Madvillainy:</dt>
              <dd>In 2003, Dumile released the album Take Me to Your Leader under his King Geedorah moniker.[40][41] In Pitchfork, Mark Martelli described Take Me to Your Leader as close to a concept album, noting how it lays out the "mythos" of the eponymous King Geedorah.[42] Martelli praised the album, particularly tracks such as "One Smart Nigger" which, in his view, were superior to other artists' attempts at political hip hop.[42] Fact, in a brief notice for a 2013 reissue of Take Me to Your Leader, called it "arguably the most cinematic" of Dumile's albums from the turn of the 21st century.[43]</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
              <dt>2005–2009: Danger Doom, Born Like This, and Ghostface collaboration:</dt>
              <dd>Although still an independent artist, Dumile took a bigger step towards the mainstream in 2005 with The Mouse and the Mask, a collaboration with the producer DJ Danger Mouse under the group name Danger Doom. The album, released on October 11, 2005, by Epitaph and Lex, was developed in collaboration with Cartoon Network's Adult Swim and featured voice actors and characters from its programs (mostly Aqua Teen Hunger Force). The Mouse and the Mask reached #41 on the Billboard 200.[52] Critic Chris Vognar, discussing the role of comedy in hip hop, argued that "Doom and Danger exemplify an absurdist strain in recent independent hip-hop, a willingness to embrace the nerdy without a heavy cloak of irony".[53] [54] In the same year, Dumile appeared on the second Gorillaz album, Demon Days.[8]</dd>
            </li>
            <li>
              <dt>2010–2021: Move to London and later collaborations:</dt>
              <dd>In early 2010, Dumile released the EP Gazzillion Ear on Lex, a compilation of remixes of "Gazzillion Ear" from Born Like This, including a remix by Thom Yorke and two mixes by Jneiro Jarel.[64] A further remix by Madvillain featuring a voicemail message from Kanye West was released online.[65] The EP coincided with Dumile's first performances outside North America. On March 5, 2010, Lex and Sónar presented the first Doom show in London, at the Roundhouse in Camden.[66] Expektoration, Dumile's second live album, was released on September 14, 2010, through Gold Dust.[67] In a review of Expektoration, Pitchfork noted that Dumile's vocal performance was more energetic than on his recordings, which it characterized as "laidback" by comparison.[68]</dd>
